This project is a face detection and recognition system that allows you to locate and identify faces in images or videos. It is built using Python, OpenCV for face detection, and the Facenet-PyTorch library for face recognition.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier and deep learning-based models to detect faces in images or videos.

- **Face Recognition**: Provides the ability to recognize known individuals by comparing the detected faces with a database of known faces.

- **Google Colab Integration**: The project is designed to run in a Google Colab notebook, making it accessible and cloud-based.

- **Image Pre-processing and Embeddings**: Images are pre-processed, converted to a compatible format, and face embeddings are extracted for recognition.

- **Threshold-Based Recognition**: A threshold defines when a detected face is recognized as a known individual, providing flexibility in the system.

- **Scalability and Expansion**: This project lays the foundation for building a more comprehensive facial recognition system. It can be extended to accommodate additional known faces and further fine-tuning.
